## Research Objectives

1. Discover an approach to use frequent and large amounts of contextual data in GIS
2. Develop a context-aware GIS for predicting and monitoring traffic collisions

---

## Research Contributions

1. Approach for incoporating generic contextual data in GIS
2. Architecture for context-aware GIS
3. Conceptual framework for building context-aware GIS solutions
